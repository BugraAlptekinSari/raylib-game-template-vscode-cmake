## What is this?

This is a modified version of the raylib game template aiming for an easy setup for Web targeted games via emscripten.

It aims to fully automate the creation of the development environment with the use of dev-containers with Visual Studio Code.

### How to use?

- Clone this repo and open it inside VS Code.
- Install the dev containers extension in VS Code and re-open the repository in a container. (You must have docker engine installed to do this. The VS Code extension can install it but I never tried that feature.)
- The extension should read the configurations I left to create a container with all the requirements for compiling and running this project. You will need internet access for this.
- Once the container is created, you will be asked to choose a kit. Choose Emscripten. Which should get you ready for Web compilation.
- You can compile the project using the `build` button that should appear at the bottom of VS Code. If you are getting errors, try deleting the build folder.
- Once compilation is done. You can run the game using the custom task I created by:
    - `Ctrl+Shift+P`
    - enter `Run Task`
    - You should see a task named `python http server` use that.
    - It should compile project and launch a http server. Click on the link you see on the terminal.
    - Which will open a port from the dev container to display the game on your browser

            - the contents of https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
        - `raylib-game-template`
            - this `README.md` and all other raylib-game-template files
- If using Visual Studio, open projects/VS2022/raylib-game-template.sln
- Select on `raylib_game` in the solution explorer, then in the toolbar at the top, click `Project` > `Set as Startup Project`
- Now you're all set up!  Click `Local Windows Debugger` with the green play arrow and the project will run.
